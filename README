README for suggest-killspike2

The killspike2 script (when slightly fixed) is an effective way to remove
large datapoints from an RRD file.  But in order to remove just the single
largest datapoint, and to find the right file to modify, we can use a little
bit of help.  That's where the suggest.cgi script comes in.

It makes assumptions, of course: it assumes you are looking at OpenNMS graphs.
It assumes you have permission to modify the RRD files.

Yep.
